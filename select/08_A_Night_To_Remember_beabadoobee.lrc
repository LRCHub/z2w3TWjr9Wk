[00:13.41] Swore I'd seen you before
[00:21.75] Watched you walk through the door
[00:30.04] Something in your eye
[00:33.29] Reminded me of somebody I used to know
[00:52.29] 
[00:46.55] You touch my back
[00:55.09] I took your hand
[01:03.52] Something from your touch felt shockingly familiar
[01:10.48] And I'd swore I'd seen you before
[01:26.98] 
[01:18.34] Oh, I swore I'd seen you before
[01:33.84] 
[01:26.48] Underneath the sheets, you enchanted me
[01:35.15] And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
[01:43.73] I shivered beneath you
[01:47.97] All wrapped up in embers
[01:51.87] It was a night to remember
[02:04.87] 
[02:14.65] Then I walked away
[02:22.56] You asked me to stay
[02:30.96] Well, you're thinkin' of what could've been
[02:36.35] But you've become someone I've seen before
[02:57.35] 
[02:46.56] I swore I'd seen you before
[03:00.06] 
[02:54.12] Underneath the sheets, you enchanted me
[03:02.79] And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
[03:11.23] I shivered beneath you
[03:15.55] All wrapped up in embers
[03:19.54] It was a night, enchantin' night
[03:26.88] To remember
[03:32.38] 
[03:34.43] Mm-mm-hm-mmh-mm-hmm
