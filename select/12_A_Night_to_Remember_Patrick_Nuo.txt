I woke up today in stereo
They played my song on the radio
Bright morning light I know you like it
But I run to my car and get inside
I'm already daydreamin 'bout tonight
Tonight is the night don't try to fight it

And even if they would say
I could have forever and a day
No way I don't want forever I just want tonight

Oh and this could be a night to remember
You and me and a night to remember
I know that we would never surrender
Even when the sun is risin' again

I get of the car and on the floor
I could never ever never never ask for more
Only the moon is full of sorrow
So let's light up this night is state of the art
The DJ'on and he's workin' hard
Nobody cares about tomorrow

And even if they tried to say
I could have forever and a day
Way I don't want forever I just want
Tonight

Its just begun there's no way back
Tonight's a day turned into black
A little suupernatural emotion
I wanna see that midnight sunshine
A little bit of dream comes true time
